  - title: When I'm Not Programming
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      When I’m not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a lot a sports such as mountain biking, road cycling, kitesuring and horse riding as well as trying to make time for things like rock climbing and playing some rugby. I currently have 2 horses and find this is a great way to get out of the house and taking my mind of things while learing to showjump.

      I’m interested in photography and videography as I like to be creative, this is mainly through sport but I enjoy landscape and abstract photography too. I like to showcase my work on instagram if you would like to take a look - jameswgrant.

      Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me working on my bikes, rock climbing at one of Bristol’s indoor climbing centres or down ‘The Rec’ supporting Bath Rugby.
