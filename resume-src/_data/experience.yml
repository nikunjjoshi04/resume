    I started working for Quixom Ttechnology as a intern during my 6th semester at University and continued full time once I had
    graduated. It was during this role that I learnt many of the fundamentals that I have been building on over
    the past years. Whilst at Quixom Ttechnology I had the opportunity to work with:
    <mark>Python</mark> <mark>Django</mark> <mark>FastApi</mark> <mark>VUE.JS</mark> <mark>Docker</mark> and <mark>AWS</mark>.

    I feel like having the opportunity to use a large range of different things early on in my career has given me
    the drive to always want to try new tools and frameworks.
